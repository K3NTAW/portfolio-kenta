 I'm Kenta, a multicultural aspiring developer based in Switzerland. Beyond coding, my diverse interests fuel my creativity. Passionate about language acquisition, I'm currently refining my skills in HTML, CSS, Java, Python, and JavaScript. In the tech realm, I've delved into Docker for workflow optimization, exploring technologies like TypeScript, AWS, MariaDB, MySQL, Cassandra DB, MongoDB, VueJS, Angular, and React. Beyond coding, I immerse myself in art, anime, and gaming. Balancing life, I hit the gym, play bass/guitar, and find joy in the culinary arts.
